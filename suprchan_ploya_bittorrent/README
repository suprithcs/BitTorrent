Project 2: BitTorrent Client Implementation.

IMPLEMENTED BY : Puneet Loya(username: ploya) and Suprith Chandrashekharachar(username: suprchan)

The project is implemented in C++11.

The code is modularized into four modules.

BitTorrent.cpp  - The main file which file which initiates the program and sets up the variables based on the given command line arguments.

bitTorrentHandshake.cpp - The file which performs the setting up of bittorrent handshake text, peerid and torrent file's info hash.
fileOperationsManager.cpp - File Manager that provides APIs to perform read or write file operations.
metainfoParser.cpp - File which handles the parsing of a given torrent file for various values like piece length, file name etc.
peer.cpp - File which takes care of all the network programming related aspects of bittorrent program. 
optionsManager.cpp : options Manager reads all the command line arguments and fills an option dictionary which stores all the options and their values as key-value pairs.
netcatLogger.cpp: netcatLogger performs the job of printing log statemtents when in verbose mode.

Required Files:

BitTorrent.cpp BitTorrent.h
BitTorrent.cpp  
fileOperationsManager.cpp fileOperationsManager.h
metainfoParser.cpp metainfoParser.h
BitTorrentLogger.cpp BitTorrentLogger.h
optionsManager.cpp optionsManager.
peer.cpp peer.h
makefile

Tasks Accomplished:

- Parse the given torrent file to determine the filename, hashes and pieces and length information.
- Connect to remote seeder(s)
- Send handshake text and verify the seeder's handshake text.
- Seeder(s) send bitfield information to the leecher(s).
- Leecher(s) sends interested message after checking the bitfield information for a file.
- Leecher(s) sends request message to the seeder's for every piece of the file.
- Seeder(s) feed the data based on the requested piece in terms of defined blocks.
- Leecher(s) verify piece integrity using SHA1 and compares it to the piece hash listed in torrent file.
- Leecher(s) writes the piece data to the output file.  
- n leechers can talk to n seeders

System Requirements:

C++ Compiler : g++/4.7.2 OR g++/4.8

Operating System : Ubuntu14.04/Redhat

Compiling:

If executing on a silo.cs.indiana.edu machine, please make sure you execute the below command at the shell prompt:

	module load gcc/4.7.2

A makefile is provided to compile the program. 

Just cd to the directory containing all files related to the project. Please refer the above section to find which all files are required.

Execute by typing in "make" at the shell prompt.

Refer the makefile for more details.

Usage:

bt-client [OPTIONS] file.torrent 
 	-h 				Print this help screen
 	-b ip 			Bind to this ip for incoming connections, ports
					are selected automatically
	-s save_file 	Save the torrent in directory save_dir (dflt: .) 
 	-l log_file 	Save logs to log_file (dflt: bt-client.log) 
 	-p ip:port 		Instead of contacting the tracker for a peer list, 
					use this peer instead, ip:port (ip or hostname) 
					(include multiple -p for more than 1 peer)
 	-I id 			Set the node identifier to id, a hex string 
					(dflt: computed based on ip and port) 
 	-l 				Listen on port instead of connecting and write output to file 
					and dest_ip refers to which ip to bind to (dflt: localhost) 
 	-v 				verbose, print additional verbose info


Examples to run the program: 

To start the seeder: ./bt-client -b localhost moby_dick.txt.torrent

Output:
[suprchan@silo without_valgrind]$ ./bt-client -b localhost moby_dick.txt.torrent

Limitations:

File reading and writing is limited to txt files.
Leecher is not allowed to bind to specific ports i.e., -b option is mentioned then program is started as a seeder.
